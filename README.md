This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is often used as a beginner's dataset for classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is available in various libraries like Scikit-learn. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each flower's measurements include:

- Sepal length in centimeters
- Sepal width in centimeters
- Petal length in centimeters
- Petal width in centimeters

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
